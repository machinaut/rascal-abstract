	abstract={Many traditional above ground Martian colony designs have used dome structures, usually constructed from a flexible
spherical membrane and inflated, to enclose the buildings of the colony. This paper will compare inflated spherical
structures to inflated toroidal structures from the standpoint of internal volume, surface area, stresses, material
requirements, stability, radiation shielding and safety.}

	journal={Nature},

	pages={506-507, 508},
	abstract={The Sabatier reaction:  CO2+4H2  CH4+2H2O(g) G°298K = -27 kcal mol-1    (1)  is an important catalytic process of wide industrial and academic interest1—3.  It is applied to syngas conversion and the treatment of waste streams.  Methane is one of the most important carbon resources of the world,  serving as an energy vector as well as a feedstock for higher-value  chemicals4—6. Despite its favourable thermodynamics, the eight-electron reduction of CO2 to CH4  by hydrogen is difficult to achieve: high-energy intermediates impose  large kinetic barriers, and the formation of side products is common.  Intensive investigations during the past decade have therefore been  aimed at improving the activity and selectivity of methanation catalysts  1–3,8–11. Although significant progress has been made in this field, elevated temperatures (T>300 °C) and pressures (P>  1 atm) are still required for methane generation to proceed at  significant rates and yields. Here we report the selective conversion of  CO2 to methane at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, using highly dispersed Ru/RuOx loaded onto TiO2 as a catalyst. The reaction rate is sharply enhanced through photo-excitation of the support material.}
