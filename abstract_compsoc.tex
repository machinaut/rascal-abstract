% *** Authors should verify (and, if needed, correct) their LaTeX system  ***
% *** with the testflow diagnostic prior to trusting their LaTeX platform ***
% *** with production work. IEEE's font choices can trigger bugs that do  ***
% *** not appear when using other class files.                            ***
% The testflow support page is at:
% http://www.michaelshell.org/tex/testflow/




% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%
% The Computer Society usually requires 12pt for submissions.
%
\documentclass[12pt,journal,compsoc]{IEEEtran}
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[12pt,journal,compsoc]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  % IEEE Computer Society needs nocompress option
  % requires cite.sty v4.0 or later (November 2003)
   \usepackage[nocompress]{cite}
\else
  % normal IEEE
   \usepackage{cite}
\fi
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later. Note also the use of a CLASSOPTION conditional provided by
% IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later.





% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
   \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
   \graphicspath{{./}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
   \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


\usepackage{mdwmath}
\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
\usepackage[tight,normalsize,sf,SF]{subfigure}
\else
\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
\fi
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. Computer Society papers
% use a larger font and \sffamily font for their captions, hence the
% additional options needed under compsoc mode. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%  \usepackage[font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%  \usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley and Jeff Goldberg.
% This package may be useful when used in conjunction with IEEEtran.cls'
% captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that submissions
% have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.3.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% For subfigure.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfigure\subfigure
% \renewcommand{\subfigure}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfigure[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat/subfig command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as

% this is a minor point as most people would not even notice if the said evil

% this:

%The abstract goes here.
This project focuses on two key components of a manned mission to Mars: habitat systems and life support systems. These two areas of mission design have presented major obstacles in the past. Our research involves analyzing these areas from a different perspective and providing innovation through the use of state-of-the-art materials and technologies.

Space missions involving a prolonged stay on an extraterrestrial surface necessitate the use of a habitation system. We will present a design for a multi-layer fabric-based inflatable structure. This system will include a flexible airlock, modular radiation shield pods, and an advanced air control and filtration system. 

The second component of this project focuses on life support systems.  Current life support systems that utilise the Sabatier reaction use macroscale metallic pellets as their catalyst to combine hydrogen and carbon dioxide in order to produce methane and water. Nanoscale catalysis is an emerging field, with much of the studies focusing on how the efficiency of catalyzed reactions can be improved by higher surface area catalyst materials. Our research investigates the effects that catalyst surface area has on the Sabatier reaction. When using nanoscale particles versus macroscale particles, you will inevitably decrease the total mass of catalyst material. As a result we will compare the effects of an increase in surface area with the effects of a decrease in total catalyst mass in order to optimise efficiency.
\end{abstract}
% IEEEtran.cls defaults to using nonbold math in the Abstract.
% This preserves the distinction between vectors and scalars. However,
% if the journal you are submitting to favors bold math in the abstract,
% then you can use LaTeX's standard command \boldmath at the very start
% of the abstract to achieve this. Many IEEE journals frown on math
% in the abstract anyway. In particular, the Computer Society does
% not want either math or citations to appear in the abstract.

% To allow for easy dual compilation without having to reenter the

\IEEEpeerreviewmaketitle



\section{Introduction}
% Computer Society journal papers do something a tad strange with the very
% first section heading (almost always called "Introduction"). They place it
% ABOVE the main text! IEEEtran.cls currently does not do this for you.
% However, You can achieve this effect by making LaTeX jump through some
% hoops via something like:
%
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \noindent\raisebox{2\baselineskip}[0pt][0pt]%
%  {\parbox{\columnwidth}{\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}%
%  \global\everypar=\everypar}}%
%  \vspace{-1\baselineskip}\vspace{-\parskip}\par
%\else
%  \section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}\par
%\fi
%
% Admittedly, this is a hack and may well be fragile, but seems to do the
% trick for me. Note the need to keep any \label that may be used right
% after \section in the above as the hack puts \section within a raised box.



% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps (small caps for compsoc).
% 
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
% 
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
% 
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
% 
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.
%\IEEEPARstart{T}{his} demo file is intended to serve as a ``starter file''
%for IEEE Computer Society journal papers produced under \LaTeX\ using
%IEEEtran.cls version 1.7 and later.
%% You must have at least 2 lines in the paragraph with the drop letter
%% (should never be an issue)
%I wish you the best of success.
\IEEEPARstart{M}{anned} exploration of our solar system has been stalled since mankind first walked on the moon forty years ago. While many probes, robots, and satellites have been launched to gather scientific data, people have not ventured far beyond our planet. The obvious next step has always been to send humans to Mars, but the difficulties of a manned mission to the Red Planet are daunting. Development of the necessary technologies for keeping a crew of astronauts alive for the lengthy trip and surface stay is an as-yet unanswered challenge, making human safety and life support an important focus of any mission planning.

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This project focuses on two key components of a manned mission to Mars: habitat systems and life support systems. These two areas of mission design have presented major obstacles in the past. Our research involves analyzing these areas from a different perspective and providing innovation through the use of state-of-the-art materials and technologies.

Space missions involving a prolonged stay on an extraterrestrial surface necessitate the use of a habitation system. We will present a design for a multi-layer fabric-based inflatable structure. This system will include a flexible airlock, modular radiation shield pods, and an advanced air control and filtration system. 

The second component of this project focuses on life support systems.  Current life support systems that utilise the Sabatier reaction use macroscale metallic pellets as their catalyst to combine hydrogen and carbon dioxide in order to produce methane and water. Nanoscale catalysis is an emerging field, with much of the studies focusing on how the efficiency of catalyzed reactions can be improved by higher surface area catalyst materials. Our research investigates the effects that catalyst surface area has on the Sabatier reaction. When using nanoscale particles versus macroscale particles, you will inevitably decrease the total mass of catalyst material. As a result we will compare the effects of an increase in surface area with the effects of a decrease in total catalyst mass in order to optimise efficiency.

\section{Introduction}
Manned exploration of our solar system has been stalled since mankind first walked on the moon forty years ago. While many probes, robots, and satellites have been launched to gather scientific data, people have not ventured far beyond our planet. The obvious next step has always been to send humans to Mars, but the difficulties of a manned mission to the Red Planet are daunting. Development of the necessary technologies for keeping a crew of astronauts alive for the lengthy trip and surface stay is an as-yet unanswered challenge, making human safety and life support an important focus of any mission planning.

\section{Requirements}
There are many obstacles to overcome when planning for human exploration of Mars, most of which are a result of the hostile environment offered by deep space and the planet’s surface. Any successful mission will have to provide a safe living space for the four-person crew during their minimum thirty-day stay on Mars. This involves dealing with several inhospitable conditions such as radiation exposure, low atmospheric pressure, temperature variation, lack of available water and oxygen, and several secondary concerns such as micrometeorite impacts and dust storms. The mission allows for five launches, each with a payload weight of 125 metric tons. All equipment must fit inside a ten meter payload shroud.

Any viable surface habitat must provide the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Shielding from radiation, including Solar Proton Events (SPE) and Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR)
  \item Stable pressure and temperature within the habitable range
  \item A breathable atmosphere and access to food and water
\end{itemize}


Important parameters to consider include
\begin{itemize}
  \item Keeping the launch weight as low as possible
  \item Making the construction and/or assembly as simple as possible
  \item Ensuring that all materials can be stored in the limited volume of a spacecraft
  \item Providing both longevity and reliability in life-support systems.
\end{itemize}

\section{Design}
\subsection{Surface Habitat}
Many proposed expeditions to the Martian surface suggest using the lander as the habitat, mainly because of the low volume-to-weight ratio of re-use and the relative simplicity of reusing equipment. However, this approach does not allow for a permanent presence on Mars and also makes the problem of designing the lander much more difficult, as it has to incorporate surface habitat facilities. Another practical option for a rigid structure is to build from prefabricated units. The main issue here is the difficulty of construction, which would require equipment to move the structural components.  This equipment is often complex and heavy.

For these reasons, inflatable structures show promise. Due to the low atmospheric pressure on Mars, an inflatable habitat can accommodate a large enough pressure differential to maintain structural support while providing significant advantages in launch weight and volume reduction. Construction involves pressurizing the interior and anchoring the structure to the surface, avoiding any complicated machinery or assembly that would be difficult for astronauts to accomplish in spacesuits.

Having a curved dome shape is desirable when dealing with micrometeorite impacts. Without an atmosphere to burn up objects on reentry, Mars is hit by many tiny meteorites that would never reach the surface on Earth. These impacts cannot be avoided with any degree of certainty, as they occur across the entirety of the planet at fairly regular intervals. However, the damage can be minimized by presenting a curved surface, decreasing the probability of a head-on strike (ref. 4). The curved outer surface also prevents aerodynamic issues with the fast (though low-density) Martian winds (ref. 2).

Crew living space, however, benefits most from a disc-shaped design. This shape provides more usable area than a dome as it does not require tiered floors or walkways to make the best use of cabin volume. Rather than examine the trade-offs between the dome shape and the disc shape, a better design simply nests the disc inside the dome. This has several added advantages, including reducing the amount of pressure pushing on the outer dome layer (lessening its tensile strength requirements). This also provides impact redundancy; should a micrometeorite penetrate the outer dome (mainly needed for radiation shielding), there is an entirely separate layer keeping the pressure and breathable atmosphere inside the living quarters. This increases crew safety while patching the hole. The entire inflatable habitat is also cheaper and easier to build with this design, mainly because the materials can be customized for their specific function.

This will result in designing three major material layers: an outermost modular radiation protection layer, a low-pressure (20 kPa) dome layer, and an innermost high-pressure (50 kPa) cabin layer. Each layer consists of a combination of materials with different useful properties, including Vectran for tensile strength, gilded BoPET for UV protection, and Demron for radiation attenuation. The outermost layer (which is primarily for radiation protection) will also make use of Martian regolith via modular shield pods to be filled for long-duration Mars missions. In order to test the capabilities of each layer, example swatches will be made and put through two types of experiments. First, tensile strength tests will be done to insure the materials can withstand the forces caused by the high pressure differential. And second, each material’s radiation attenuation will be characterised through the use of a gamma ray emitter.

Finally, a flexible structure allows for the design and use of an inflatable airlock.  Current airlock technology involves pumping air out of a sealed rigid structure.  On the Space Shuttle, 10\% of the air in the airlock is lost each opening cycle, representing a drain on oxygen and buffer gases in the life support system (ref. 3). We will develop a prototype two-person inflatable airlock that will take advantage of the fabric technology used in the habitat. For any long-term mission, this improved airlock will greatly reduce losses of non-replenishable gases while maintaining the safety provided by a two-person design.

\subsection{Sabatier Reactor Catalyst}
Launching a mission to Mars with bulk supplies of oxygen and water is infeasible due to weight and space constraints. Current studies on the longevity and reliability of reclamation and filtration techniques show that these processes alone are not sufficient to provide these necessary resources.  Furthermore, the atmosphere on Mars is thin and has very little oxygen. Carbon dioxide, however, is abundant comprising 95\% of the atmosphere (ref. 1). It then becomes an obvious solution to convert this carbon dioxide into water and oxygen. Two of the most commonly discussed chemical reactions that utilize carbon dioxide as a reactant to produce water are the Bosch reaction and the Sabatier reaction. The Bosch reaction is problematic because of carbon buildup, but the Sabatier reaction has been tested and examined by NASA for decades.

The basic chemical equation of the Sabatier reaction is as follows:
\[ CO_2 + 4H_2 \xrightarrow{Catalysis} CH_4 + 2H_2O + heat.\] % actual energy calc would be nice
The bulk carbon dioxide from the Martian atmosphere (or from respiration on-board the transit vessel) is mixed with hydrogen brought from Earth and run through a tube filled with a catalyst (usually nickel or ruthenium). The reaction is exothermic, and produces methane and water. The methane can then be used for fuel, either as a return launch propellant or for heating the habitat. The water can either be used for human consumption or electrolyzed to extract diatomic oxygen (for breathing) and hydrogen (to go back into the reactor). We believe this reaction is the best choice for water and oxygen production on the Martian surface.

A basic Sabatier reactor is a simple tube or pipe filled with spherical pellets. Since catalyst efficiency is related to surface area, alternate catalyst designs that maximize or increase surface area might improve overall reaction performance, with the ultimate goal of either miniaturizing the reactor for portable applications (as on a spacesuit) or facilitating bulk use to replenish a habitat. Size and weight are always extremely important properties to control in space systems, and a reactor’s size and weight could potentially be minimized through optimized nanoscale catalysis, without reducing output efficiency. 

Our research explores this idea of nanoscale catalysis with the use of nickel nanoparticles. These nanoparticles will be deposited onto a microscale substrate. The substrate we have chosen to use is a fused silica quartz microfiber. These microfibers are on average about 4 microns in diameter and prove to be a very resilient substrate while still providing a large surface area for the deposition of the nanoparticles . This type of catalyst will be tested in a small-scale Sabatier reactor and compared to a nickel pellet catalyst control to determine what effect, if any, the new nanoscale design has on the reaction.


\section{Conclusion}
The greatest obstacle to manned missions in the space program is ensuring the safety of the astronauts involved. Improvements in habitat design and life support systems would be important steps towards demonstrating the feasibility of a human mission to Mars. The quantitative and qualitative analysis of a simple and safe inflatable fabric-based habitat system, as well as an analysis of the advantages that nanoscale catalysis provides in life support reactors are important components in such improvements and vital in any comprehensive study on manned Mars mission technology.
